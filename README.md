# Android Notes App

In December 2019, I came back home from college to find my mom struggling to look up her notes in her Android phone.
Bored and wanting to make use of what I have learnt, I coded an Android application called Notes for my mom.
This was in fact my first Android application that I developed alone. The whole application took around a week to develop.
I learnt a great deal from this hands-on project such as SQLite, and Pop-up dialogs.
While the project is not the best application, I still want to share it and make it an open source project so that
people can study the code and other things.

# Features
Here are some features my mom found useful:
- searching for keywords
- filtering the search
- sorting notes
- deleting a note (selecting and deleting many notes are not implemented.)

To get start, you need to have Android Studio installed in your computer and maybe an Android phone.
Please feel free to study and make changes to the app.

If you have any questions or problems, you may send me a message and I will try my best to help you.
